        In 2010, Morton's friend and Maroon 5's musical director Adam Blackstone asked him to audition 
        for a keyboardist/backing vocalist spot in the band. Morton was the first to audition and 
        left an indelible mark on the group. Since then, he has played with Maroon 5 in concerts and other live performances. 
        From 2012 to 2014 Morton filled-in for the band's keyboardist, Jesse Carmichael, 
        who was taking a temporary break from performing with the band, as stated on their official website in March 2012. 
        In 2012, he joined the band as a permanent member, contributing his vocals and keyboard parts to Maroon 5's fourth studio album, 
        Overexposed, and continuing to do so during the process of recording the band's fifth album, V.
