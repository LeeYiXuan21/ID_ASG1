        <h1>Matt Flynn : Biography</h1>
        <p1>
            Matthew "Matt" Flynn  is the drummer of American pop rock band Maroon 5.
            In 2006, after being the band's touring drummer for two years,
            Flynn has officially replaced the original drummer of Maroon 5, Ryan Dusick,
            who left the group due to serious wrist and shoulder injuries sustained 
            from constant touring after the release of their first album, Songs About Jane in 2002.
            Prior to joining Maroon 5, Flynn has played drums for The B-52's, Chicago, Gavin DeGraw and Gandhi

            Flynn was born in Woodstock, New York. When Flynn was 14 years old, 
            he picked up his first pair of drumsticks in his father's basement 
            and immediately started drumming the beat to "Jump" by Van Halen, impressing his father greatly. 
            Later that year he came third in his high school talent show, behind stand up comedian Daniel Tosh 
            and a dance crew known as "Tropic Lightning".
            Flynn graduated from Gunn High School and briefly attended San Diego State University.
