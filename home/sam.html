A frequent collaborator with the band since the 1990s, he joined as a touring member in 2012 and was promoted to an official member in 2016.

        Farrar was born in Los Angeles, California, to Australian parents. 
        His father, John Farrar, was a member of The Shadows and also carved a successful songwriting career, 
        penning many of Olivia Newton-John's big hits as well as producing nearly every one of her albums during her most successful years.
        His mother, Pat Carroll, was a successful Australian pop singer in the 1960s. He attended The Buckley School.
        Sam is married to Stephanie Eitel, formerly a member of the band Agent Sparks.
        Their daughter Vesper Pearl Farrar was born on August 6, 2009, and their son Flynn Roscoe Farrar was born on January 14, 2014.
        He graduated Pitzer College.

        In 2012, Farrar became a touring member of Maroon 5, playing various instruments, 
        including guitars, occasional bass guitar, percussion and additional keyboards, 
        singing backing vocals and providing samples and other special effects .
        After touring with the band as a touring member for the next couple of years, 
        Farrar appeared in an official, promotional photo of Maroon 5 for the first time, in late 2016.
        He is also featured on the cover of the band's sixth studio album, Red Pill Blues 
        all of this can be seen as confirmation, that Farrar became an official member of Maroon 5,
        making them a seven-piece band. He replaced Madden as bassist in 2020 following the former's departure from the band.
