    <h1>Jesse Royal Carmichael : Biography</h1>
    <p1>
        Jesse Royal Carmichael (born April 2, 1979) is the keyboardist, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist in the American pop rock band Maroon 5. 
        He is also known for his solo project, which is called 1863 and his side project titled Circuit Jerks.
        Carmichael was born in Boulder, Colorado, United States. His father, Bob Carmichael, is a photographer, 
        who also takes pictures during Maroon 5's tours. Jesse also has a younger sister, Annie. 
        He first started playing the guitar in junior high, rather than the keyboards (for which he is known in the band Maroon 5). 
        On March 9, 2012, Carmichael was announced to take a break from playing in Maroon 5, 
        for an undetermined amount of time to focus more on his studies of "music and the healing arts" (spiritual healing). 
        However, two years later (in 2014), he returned to the band in time to record for their fifth studio album, entitled V.
