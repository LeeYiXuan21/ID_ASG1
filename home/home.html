          Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California. 
          It currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, lead guitarist James Valentine, 
          drummer Matt Flynn, keyboardist PJ Morton and multi-instrumentalist and bassist Sam Farrar.
          Original members Levine, Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, and drummer Ryan Dusick first came together as Kara's Flowers in 1994, 
          while they were still in high school.

          The origin of Maroon 5 could be tracked back to 1994 when Adam Noah Levine 
          and Jesse Royal Carmichael  were still the students of Brentwood High School in Los Angeles, California. 
          One night, they went out together with Adam's old friend, Ryan Michael Dusick  who was an alumni from the same school.
          All of them came up with an idea to make music together as a pop rock band which they quickly named Kara's Flowers. 
          Looking for one more member among the other schoolmates, they were finally joined by Michael Madden 
          after he responded positively upon their request to include him in the band.
          With Adam in vocal also guitar, Ryan in drums, Jesse in guitar, and Mickey in bass, 
          Kara's Flowers made their first performance at West Hollywood's Whisky A Go-Go on September 16, 1995. \
          Creating quite a buzz during their journey around some other clubs in L.A., the band were successfully signed to Reprise Records,
          a division of Warner Music Group, and thus released their debut album, "The Fourth World" in 1997.
          Unfortunately, it did not turn out well for the record only sold five thousand copies and was considered as a failure. 
          Disappointed, the quartet decided to leave Reprise in 1999, turning their attention to education. 
          Ryan and Mickey chose to study at UCLA while Adam and Jesse entered Five Towns College in Long Island, New York.

          Unable to resist the desire to play music again, both Adam and Jesse decided to give up their study, 
          thus immediately returning to L.A. where they reunited with Mickey and Ryan. 
          As the band added some elements of black music, particularly R&B, to their explosive rock & roll sound,
          Adam started to develop a new style in singing and songwriting.
          With this change, the band decided to start it all over again,
          holding some performances around the city. At one of their shows in 2001,
          they met James Burgon Valentine  who was the guitarist of a band called Square. 
          Blown away by James' talent, James joined them after going through some heavy conversation to convince him. 
          That was when the personnel came up with the idea of a new identity for the band.
          "We clearly weren't Kara's Flowers anymore, with the addition of James and an entirely new approach to music," 
          Adam explained. "Also, if you name a band when you're 15, by the time you're 23 you're probably not gonna like it very much." 
          Without spending too much time, they eventually agreed to use the name "Maroon 5."
