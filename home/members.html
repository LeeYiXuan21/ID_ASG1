    <h1>Jesse Royal Carmichael : Biography</h1>
    <p1>
        Jesse Royal Carmichael (born April 2, 1979) is the keyboardist, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist in the American pop rock band Maroon 5. 
        He is also known for his solo project, which is called 1863 and his side project titled Circuit Jerks.
        Carmichael was born in Boulder, Colorado, United States. His father, Bob Carmichael, is a photographer, 
        who also takes pictures during Maroon 5's tours. Jesse also has a younger sister, Annie. 
        He first started playing the guitar in junior high, rather than the keyboards (for which he is known in the band Maroon 5). 
        On March 9, 2012, Carmichael was announced to take a break from playing in Maroon 5, 
        for an undetermined amount of time to focus more on his studies of "music and the healing arts" (spiritual healing). 
        However, two years later (in 2014), he returned to the band in time to record for their fifth studio album, entitled V.

    <h1> Ryan Michael Dusick: Biography</h1>
    <p1>
        Ryan Michael Dusick (born September 19, 1977) is the former and original drummer of American pop rock band Maroon 5.

    </p1>
    <p2>
        The constant performing proved to be detrimental to Dusick, 
        who wound up hurting his arm so badly from the continuous shows that he was forced to stop playing in late 2004. 
        As he temporarily sat out to undergo tests and attempt to heal, Maroon 5 continued their heavy touring regime with musicians 
        such as Ryland Steen and Josh Day taking Dusick's place behind the drum kit.
        Matt Flynn officially replaced Ryan Dusick in September 2006 .
