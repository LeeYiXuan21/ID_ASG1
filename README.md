###Purpose:
My Project is about a website to give information about the band Imagine Dragon and sells merchandise of the band. The purpose of to website is to provide a platform for people who are interested in the band or fans of the band to find out more and get merchandise of the band. The site's users are fans and potential fans who wish to learn more about the band's history and the band members, learn more about their songs and know their schedules. Site owner's goal is the band are interested in leting more people know or learn about the band and selling more of the merchandise.

###Design Process:
I started with reasearching about the band and about different websites. Then,  i take down what information i need and what features i'm going to put in the website. After that, i started sketching the wireframe and my ideas, then use adobe XD to store my sketches. Since the website is for fans or potential fans of the band , i wanted to give reliable information and thought of things they want to know about and what they want. My project is the best way to help them achieve the things they want to achieved as a user type, I want to perform an action of introducing the band and selling merchandise , so that I can achieve a goal of letting more people become interested in the band.

##Wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that I created as part of the design process:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
